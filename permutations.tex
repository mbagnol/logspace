\notations{Given any set of wirings $\,E\,$, we write respectively $\,\vect(E)\,$, $\,\alg(E)\,$ and $\,\alg^\dagger(E)\,$ the vector space%
%(that is, the set of \emph{finite} linear combinations of elements of $\,E\,$)
, the algebra and the $\ast$-algebra generated by $\,E\,$.

Moreover, we set 
$$\BF 1:=\,\BB C.1=\vect\{\:1\:\}=\alg^\dagger\{\:1\:\}\qquad\quad
u\sflow v:=\, u\flow v +v\flow u\qquad\quad
%\pflow u:=\,u\flow u
$$
We will always write ``$\ast$-algebra'' instead of the more correct ``$\ast$-subalgebra of $\,\ualg\,$'', for brevity.
}

\smallskip
Two important features of $\,\ualg\,$ for this work are the possibility of representing (unbounded) tensor products and finite-support permutations of $\,\BB N\,$.

\define[tensor product]
	{Let $\,u\flow v\,$ and $\,t\flow w\,$ be two flows. Suppose we have chosen representatives of the renaming classes that have their sets of variables disjoint. We define their tensor product as
	$$(u\flow v) \tensor (t\flow w):=\: u\p t \flow v\p w
	$$
	The operation is extended to wirings by bilinearity.
	
	\smallskip
	Given two $\ast$-algebras $\,\C A,\C B\,$, we define their tensor product as the $\ast$-algebra
	$$\C A\tensor \C B:= \,\vect\set{F\tensor G}{F\in\C A,\:G\in \C B}
	$$
	\vspace{-7mm}
}

This actually defines an embedding of the algebraic tensor product of $\ast$-algebras into $\,\ualg\,$, which means in particular that $\,(F\tensor G)(P\tensor Q)=(FP)\tensor(GQ)\,$.

\smallskip
\notation{We carry on the convention for the binary function symbol and write the tensor product of $\ast$-algebras as \emph{right associating} to avoid an excess of parenthesis: $$\,\C A\tensor\C B\tensor\C C \::=\:\C A\tensor(\C B\tensor\C C) \,$$}


\define[unbounded tensor]
	{Let $\,\C A\,$ be a $\ast$-algebra. We define the $\ast$-algebras $\,\C A^n\,$ for all $\,n\in \BB N\,$ as
	$$\C A^0:= \BF 1 \quad\text{and}\quad \C A^{n+1}:=\,\C A \tensor \C A^n
	$$
	and the $\ast$-algebra $\ \displaystyle\C A^\infty:=\:\bigcup_{n\in N} \:\C A^n\ $.% and $\ \displaystyle\C A^{\leq N}:=\:\bigcup_{n\in\{\,1,\dots,N\,\}}^N \:\C A^n\ $.
}

We will consider finite permutations, but allow them to be composed even when their domain of definition is not the same.

\notations{If $\,\sigma\in \F S_n\,$, we define $\,\sigma_{+k}\in \F S_{n+k}\,$ as the permutation $\,\sigma\,$ extended to $\,\{\:1,\dots,n,\dots,n+k\:\}\,$ letting $\,\sigma_{+k}(n+i):=n+i\,$ for $\,i\in\{\,1,\dots,k\,\}\,$.

We also write $\,1_k:=\Id_{\{1,\dots,k\}}\in \F S_k\,$.}

\define[representation]
	{To a permutation $\,\sigma \in \F S_n\,$ we associate the flow
	$$[\sigma]:= \,x_1\p x_2\p\,\cdots\,\p x_n \p y\flow x_{\sigma(1)}\p x_{\sigma(2)}\p\,\cdots\,\p x_{\sigma(n)}\p y
	$$
%	We will write $\,\,$
	
	We will omit the brackets when there is no ambiguity.
}

\lemma[representation]
	{\label{open-represent}For $\,\sigma\in \F S_n\,$ and $\,\tau\in\F S_{n+k}\,$ we have
	$$[\sigma_{+k}]=[\sigma][1_{n+k}]=[1_{n+k}][\sigma] \qquad
	[\sigma_{+k}\circ\tau]=[\sigma][\tau]\qquad
	 \text{and} \qquad
	 [\sigma^{-1}]=[\sigma]^\dagger
	$$
	\vspace{-5mm}
}


\define[permutation algebra]
	{For $\,n\in \BB N\,$ we set $\:[\F S_n]:=\,\set{[\sigma]}{\sigma \in \F S_n}\,$ and $\,\C S_n:=\,\alg^\dagger[\F S_n]=\vect[\F S_n]\,$.
	
	We define then $\:\displaystyle\C S:=\,\:\bigcup_{n\in \BB N} \C S_n\:$, which we call the \emph{permutation algebra}.
