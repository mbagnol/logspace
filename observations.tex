We now define \emph{observations}, programs computing on representations of words.
They  lie in a particular $\ast$-algebra based on the representation of permutations presented in Sect.\ref{permutation}.

\define[observation algebra]
	{An \emph{observation} over a finite set of symbols $\,\Sigma\,$ is any element of $\,\C O_\Sigma^\concrete\,$ where $\,\C O_\Sigma:=\,\closed\tensor\Sigma\tensor\IO\tensor\C S\,$, \textit{i.e.} a \emph{finite} sum of flows of the form
	\[(s'\p\TT c' \p \TT d' \flow s\p\TT c\p\TT d)\tensor[\sigma]\]
with $\,\TT c,\TT c'\in\Sigma\,$, $\,\TT d,\TT d'\in \IO\,$, $\,s,s'\,$ closed terms and $\,\sigma\,$ is a permutation.

\smallskip
Moreover when an observation happens to be an isometric wiring, we will call it an \emph{isometric observation}.
