It proposes two cut-elimination procedures, the lazy one being in linear time. The solution is shown to be compatible with quantifiers, and the structural rules of exponentials are also accommodated. Traditional proof-theory deals with cut-elimination; these results are usually obtained by means of sequent calculi, with the consequence that 75 \% of a cutelimination proof is devoted to endless commutations of rules. It is hard to be happy with this, mainly because: ◮ the structure of the proof is blurred by all these cases; ◮ whole forests have been destroyed in order to print the same routine lemmas; ◮ this is not extremely elegant. However old-fashioned proof-theory, which is concerned with the ritual question: “is-that-theory-consistent? ” never really cared. The situation changed when subtle algorithmic aspects of cut-elimination became prominent: typically},

	abstract = {The paper expounds geometry of interaction, for the first time in the full case, i.e. for all connectives of linear logic, including additives and constants. The interpretation is done within a C ∗-algebra which is induced by the rule of resolution of logic programming, and therefore the execution formula can be presented as a simple logic programming loop. Part of the data is public (shared channels) but part of it can be viewed as private dialect (defined up to isomorphism) that cannot be shared during interaction, thus illustrating the theme of communication without understanding. One can prove a nilpotency (i.e. termination) theorem for this semantics, and also its soundness w.r.t. a slight modification of familiar sequent calculus in the case of exponential-free conclusions. 1},

	title = {Geometry of Interaction {IV:} the Feedback Equation},
	shorttitle = {Geometry of Interaction {IV}},
	abstract = {The first three papers on Geometry of Interaction [9, 10, 11] did establish the universality of the feedback equation as an explanation of logic; this equation corresponds to the fundamental operation of logic, namely cut-elimination, i.e., logical consequence; this is also the oldest approach to logic, syllogistics! But the equation was essentially studied for those Hilbert space operators coming from actual logical proofs. In this paper, we take the opposite viewpoint, on the arguable basis that operator algebra is more primitive than logic: we study the general feedback equation of Geometry of Interaction, h(x⊕y)  = x ′ ⊕σ(y), where h,σ are hermitian, �h �  ≤ 1, and σ is a partial symmetry, σ 3 = σ. We show that the normal form which yields the solution σ�h�(x)  = x ′ in the invertible case can be extended in a unique way to the general case, by various techniques, basically order-continuity and associativity. From this we expect a definite break with essentialism à la Tarski: an interpretation of logic which does not presuppose logic! 1},
