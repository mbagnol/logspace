\begin{abstract}
	We present an algebraic characterization of the complexity classes \textsc{Logspace} and \textsc{NLogspace} of deterministic and non-deterministic logarithmic space, using an algebra with a composition law based on unification. We show that computation can be modeled in it by means of specific subalgebras related finite permutations groups.

We also show that the construction can be naturally related with a notion pointer machines, which is another model of logarithmic space computation.
