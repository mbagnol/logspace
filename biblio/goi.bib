	title = {Proof-nets and the Hilbert space},
	abstract = {Girard's execution formula (given in [Gir88a]) is a decomposition of usual fi-reduction (or cut-elimination) in reversible, local and asynchronous elementary moves. It can easily be presented, when applied to a -term or a net, as the sum of maximal paths on the -term/net that are not cancelled by the algebra L    (as was done in [Dan90, Reg92]). It is then natural to ask for a characterization of those paths, that would be only of geometric nature. We prove here that they are exactly those paths that have residuals in any reduct of the -term/net. Remarkably, the proof puts to use for the first time the interpretation of  -terms/nets as operators on the Hilbert space. 1 Presentation  -Calculus is simple but not completely convincing as a real machine-language. Real machine instructions have a fixed run-time; a fi-reduction step does not. Some implementations do map fi-reductions into sequences of real elementary steps (as in environment machines for example) but they use a global time t...},
