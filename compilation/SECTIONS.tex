\begin{abstract}
	We present an algebraic characterization of the complexity classes L and NL of deterministic and non-deterministic logarithmic space, using an algebra with a composition law based on unification. We show that computation can be modeled in it by means of specific subalgebras related to groups of finite permutations.

We also show that the construction can be related with a notion pointer machines, a model of logarithmic space computation.
